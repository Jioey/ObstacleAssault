# UE5 Obstacle Assault
A platformer game that I created following the tutorial in the [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) Udemy course. The player is from the ThirdPersonCharacter preset and assets are from online.
### What I learned
* Using the Tick and SetActorLocation/Rotation functions in C++ to modify the moving platforms.
* Integrating asset packages into my own project
